# Geovisualization and Advanced Cartography: Assignment 3

The third assignment is again a Leaflet map that uses a snaking plugin to visualize the historic Silk 
Route and the 21st century Belt and Road initiative that follows the historic trails.

Each individual route can be interactively triggered into animation.
The project can be accessed under https://nkls-jy.github.io/Course-Geovis/Geovis_A3/
